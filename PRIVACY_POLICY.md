# Privacy Policy for GetAnswers - AI Test Helper

**Effective Date:** August 25, 2025

Thank you for using GetAnswers - AI Test Helper ("the Extension"). This privacy policy outlines how we handle your data. Our core principle is to collect and process the minimum amount of information necessary to provide the Extension's functionality.

## Information We Process

To provide you with answers, we need to process the content of the webpage you are on.

* **Page Content:** When you activate the Extension on a webpage, the text content of that page is collected and sent to our secure backend server for analysis. This is the **only** data we process.

* **Data We DO NOT Collect:** We are committed to user privacy. We **do not** collect, store, or track any **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Your name, email address, or IP address.
    * Your browsing history or activity on other websites.
    * Any information from your Google account.

## How Your Information is Used

The sole purpose of processing the page content is to provide the core functionality of the Extension. The process is as follows:

1.  The text from your active webpage is sent securely to our backend server, hosted on Render.
2.  Our server analyzes this text to identify potential multiple-choice questions.
3.  This text is then sent to a third-party AI service (**Mistral AI**) for parsing and analysis.
4.  The structured result is returned to the Extension and displayed to you.

The page content is processed in memory and is **not** permanently stored or logged on our servers in connection with any personal identifiers.

## Data Caching

To improve performance and reduce costs, our system may create a "definitive cache key" from the questions found on a page. This key is an anonymized, irreversible hash of the normalized question text. It allows us to quickly serve results for common quizzes without re-processing them. This cache is not linked to any specific user.

## Third-Party Services

To function, we rely on the following third-party service:

* **Mistral AI:** The text content of the page is sent to the Mistral AI API for processing. We do not control the data policies of Mistral AI.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy in the extension's description on the Chrome Web Store.
